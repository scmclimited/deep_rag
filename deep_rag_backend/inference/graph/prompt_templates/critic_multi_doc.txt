Given the plan:
{plan}
And notes:
{notes}

This is a multi-document query. The user wants comprehensive information from multiple documents.
Propose refined sub-queries (max 2) to retrieve MORE complete evidence from the documents.
Focus on:
1. Retrieving more chunks from each document
2. Getting document metadata (titles, types, structure)
3. Extracting key content sections

Write queries as natural language questions without special characters like &, *, |, !, :, or quotes. 
Use plain text only. For example, write "Hygiene and DX" instead of "Hygiene & DX".
